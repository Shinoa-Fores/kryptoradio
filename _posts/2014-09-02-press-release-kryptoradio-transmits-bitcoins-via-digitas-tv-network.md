Kryptoradio, developed by Koodilehto, will begin sending Bitcoin transactions through the national TV network on 1 September 2014. During the pilot broadcast, 90 of Digita’s TV broadcasting stations will transmit simultaneously, which will be receivable in the whole of Finland, excluding the northernmost Lapland and Aland. The pilot broadcast is used to evaluate the suitability of digital television network for transmitting payment data and to enable application development. The pilot broadcast lasts till the end of October.

Broadcast data will include Bitcoin transactions, blocks and exchange rates with regards to the most common currencies. These data enable the reception and monitoring of Bitcoin payments without an Internet connection, which enhances the reliability of payment confirmation. In addition to Bitcoins, Kryptoradio will transmit the Finnish FIMK cryptocurrency.

During the pilot broadcast, anyone can develop applications that use Kryptoradio. To promote this opportunity, Helsinki Hacklab is arranging with Koodilehto a Kryptoradio developers’ meeting at Helsingin Kaupunkivertas in Helsinki, Finland, on Sunday 7 September 2014, beginning at 10 o’clock. The purpose of the event is to introduce Kryptoradio and promote the development of devices and applications that use it.

“It’s interesting and exciting to participate in opening up new possibilities. The terrestrial TV network is viable and it’s great to learn that it can be used in a multitude of ways. In Digita, we’re boldly exploring the possibilities and so this is a great opportunity to advance our competences together with Koodilehto,” asserts Markus Ala-Hautala, Director of Business and Service Management at Digita.

Koodilehto is a Finnish software company that combines open technologies for the benefit of its clients. Krypto FIN ry has developed the FIMK system and aims to advance its use. Digita operates wireless communication networks, governing the terrestrial radio and TV networks’ broadcasting stations and masts. Helsinki Hacklab ry aims to develop and advance the scientific, technological, artistic and crafts skills of its members and its neighborhood.
