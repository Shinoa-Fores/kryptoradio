Koodilehto has made an agreement with Digita for transmitting
Kryptoradio to the end of this year. We continue broadcasting in E
multiplex which covers 95% of Finnish population.

Joel has been busy with his other job which has kept the project a bit
silent for some weeks. Meanwhile we have had some problems with our
RS232 hardware which was fortunately fixed without replacing any
hardware. Kryptoradio broadcasting is up again after a downtime.

Our co-operation with [Krypto Fin ry.](http://fimk.fi/) has
ended. This means that the cryptocurrency FIMKRYPTO is no longer
transmitted. The deal was originally for two months so nothing
dramatical here. Now there is some spare bandwidth for transmitting
data, including other cryptocurrencies. Please contact us if you want
your data on air!

Also, Koodilehto is attending to the [Slush14](http://www.slush.org/)
startup event going on in Helsinki, Finland. If you want to talk with
us there, just drop an email or tweet to
[@Koodilehto](https://twitter.com/koodilehto).
