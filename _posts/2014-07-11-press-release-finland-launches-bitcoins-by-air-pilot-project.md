Finnish quasi-national cryptocurrency FIMKrypto has struck a
partnership deal with Koodilehto, a Finnish software company, in order
to launch world’s first development project that aims to broadcast
cryptocurrency transactions through national TV broadcast networks in
real time.

The technology, coined Kryptoradio, enables merchants and consumers to
receive real time P2P network transaction data with any standard
Digital TV device and custom software without the requirement of
Internet or mobile network connection.

The broadcast transaction data consists of Bitcoin and FIMKrypto
transactions, which are encoded and forwarded to the network of
Digita, the Finnish national terrestrial TV operator. The broadcast
covers 95% of the Finnish territory of approximately 5 million
people. The technology, once completed, will be portable to other
countries worldwide.

The pilot broadcast project starting in September 1 lasts two months,
and commercial production phase is planned to begin later this
year. The pilot is free-to-air and open for everyone interested in
developing devices and applications.

FIMKrypto (FIMK) is a cryptocurrency launched in early July by
non-profit association Krypto FIN ry. Prior to FIMK’s launch the
association received 533 Bitcoins (approx. 250 000 EUR) in donations
from domestic and international donors. The association coordinates
the FIMKrypto project and organizes a national basic income plan paid
in the cryptocurrency.
