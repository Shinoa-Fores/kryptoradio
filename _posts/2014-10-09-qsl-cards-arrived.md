![Kryptoradio QSL cards](/images/qsl_cards.jpg)

Today, Joel's got a package from
[LZ3HI](http://www.lz3hi.com/index1.htm). QSL cards. Thousand of
them. So be prepared, in a week we are introducing QSL campaign for
everybody around. We prefer reception reports of real DVB-T broadcast
but due to huge number of cards available, we accept also reports of
successful setups of listening to our brand new Internet gateway. :-)

For those not familiar with QSL cards: It is a written confirmation of
either a two-way radiocommunication between two amateur radio
stations, or as in our case a one-way reception of a signal from a
broadcasting station. During the early days of radio broadcasting, the
ability for a radio set to receive distant signals was a source of
pride for many consumers and hobbyists. (Source:
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QSL_card)). Because we are
also doing history with Kryptoradio project, and we like to share you
a remembrance item of the first months of this project.

So, keep your receivers at hand or go buy a one if you live near the
broadcast. We are looking forward of listening reports not only from
Finland but especially from borderlands of Sweden, Estonia, and
Russia! It's tough job to receive the signal outside of the official
coverage area, but take that as a challenge!

Version 0.0.2 of the receiver software will be available soon,
too. Stay in touch!
