Kryptoradio receiver software is out. Everything is still very experimental so be prepared. [Installation instructions](https://github.com/koodilehto/kryptoradio/tree/master/receiver) are available on Github. There is also an [experimental package for Ubuntu](http://kryptoradio.koodilehto.fi/packages/haskell-kryptoradio-receiver-utils_0.0.1_amd64.deb).

As always, please report problems to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/koodilehto/kryptoradio/issues) or join our IRC channel #bitcoinradio at Freenode.
