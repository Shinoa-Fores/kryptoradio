Kryptoradio project ended in December, 2014 but the project is not
entirely forgotten in the last year and a half. The project raised
huge audience and there has been some serious commercial interest
but nothing I am really interested in because they would destroy 
the original idea of Kryptoradio – distributing the Bitcoin ledger
autonomously without Internet connectivity.

I want to thank all our supporters out there. Many of you really
wanted this to happen globally. We were doing this mostly because of
interest to the technology. The Bitcoin economy back then and even
today is far too small to keep this running just on donations. On the
other hand, putting in any subscription model would severely hurt the
anonymity aspect of blockchain broadcasting. Therefore I lost interest
to the project in beginning of 2015.

Since then I have worked with Bitcoin technology in
[Prasos Ltd.](http://prasos.fi/) located in Jyväskylä, Finland.
We have done great things such as
[Denarium physical bitcoins](http://denarium.com/)
and a exchange service with a volume of million euros per month.
I believe the Bitcoin economy is still on this phase where bitcoins
are for traders and collectors, although I see growing interest in
peer-to-peer market such as [OpenBazaar](https://openbazaar.org/).
If Bitcoin economy goes that way, removing the unnecessary middlemen
from our economy, that would pave the road for Kryptoradio and other
alternative ways for transferring financial transactions.

Also, I have become a licensed radio amateur last April. My call sign
is OH6EYA. There may be some common ground between peer-to-peer cash
and amateur radio. We'll see what it is in the future.

Feel free to follow me at Twitter. I sometimes tweet in Finnish but
hope it's not too bad. [@Zouppen](https://twitter.com/zouppen)
