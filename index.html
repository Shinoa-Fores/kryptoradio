<h2 id="general">What is Kryptoradio?</h2>
<p>Kryptoradio is a bitcoin data transmission system that</p>
<ul>
<li>transmits bitcoin transactions, blocks, and currency exchange data,</li>
<li>does all this in real-time,</li>
<li>uses terrestrial television (<a title="Digital Video Broadcasting â€” Terrestrial" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a>) transmitters around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoins in the air</strong>, literally speaking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any unidirectional digital transmission path with a sufficient
error correction is suitable for this project. In addition to DVB-T there are many other possible ways to transmit Bitcoin stream like subcarriers of FM radio transmission, amateur radio, and DAB. We chose DVB-T for our pilot project because of its flexibility and wide support in most parts of the world, shown in blue in the map below (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Digital_broadcast_standards.svg">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>The software part of this project consists of two separate applications: serializer and deserializer. The former connects to the the
bitcoin network, receives transactions and blocks, then puts them into
a queue, which is then processed according to given priorities and finally serialized to a stream of bytes. The result is
passed to transmitter. On the other end, a tuner is connected to the deserializer,
which parses the incoming stream and emulates a bitcoin node serving transactions and blocks to all connected bitcoin nodes.

<p>
The data stream can contain other information, such as <strong>exchange rates</strong>
between bitcoins and traditional currencies.</p>
<p>This scheme makes it easy to construct <strong>affordable receivers</strong> that do
not need mobile data connections in order to follow bitcoin traffic and
to react to the received bitcoin payments. This would make it possible
to build bitcoin counterpart for cash payment terminals, anything from
a cash register to a coin operated self-service laundry. If the
receiver application follows only transactions relevant to itself, it
will be possible to build it using even an ARM
microcontroller.</p>
<p>Also, it allows an alternative way to access the bitcoin network in cases where only a very low speed Internet connection is available. When the block sizes grow in the future, the scheme will scale up. Handling of <strong>10 megabyte blocks</strong> in the future is not an issue. And, for all the tin foil hat wearers out there, this is a way to <strong>connect to bitcoin network without a trace</strong>! You only need online access when you want to make transactions yourself.</p>

<h4 id="software">The software</h4>

<p>The application is programmed in C (gnu99) and depends on Glib,
LibSSL and Linux. It is licensed
under <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-affero-gpl.html"

<ul>
<li>Serializer connects and stays in the bitcoin network.</li>
<li>Serializer knows how to send transactions and blocks to serial port.</li>
<li>Serializer optimizes the blocks by referencing to already sent
transactions by their tx id, and does not retransmit them in a new
block. The receiver assembles the block, keeping it compatible with
all bitcoin clients. (This is probably the first implementation
which solves a
<a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Scalability#Network">
known scalability problem</a> of bitcoin.)</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib">Zlib</a> compression of transaction and block data. Compression ratio on real data is about 1.25.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not yet finished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper transaction prioritization based on the predicted queue position.</li>
<li>Serial traffic format needs rethinking and someone else's opinion.</li>
<li>Serial traffic signing. The receiver needs to be sure that the data has not been forged.</li>
<li>Receiver application (deserializer and DVB receiver).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not yet started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Testing in real radio networks.</li>
<li>Sending of exchange rates.</li>
<li>Support for other cryptocurrencies, mostly <a href="http://fimk.fi/">Fimkrypto</a>.</li>

<p>We have successfully finished negotiations for pilot stage (test
transmissions) in Finland using Digita's nationwide DVB-T network. The
pilot stage is executed during two months when the signal is
broadcasted 24 hours a day over densely populated areas of
Finland. Channel group E is selected for pilot stage. Click the map on
the right for more information. (Map source:
<a href="http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiedosto:Suomi.karttapohja.svg">
Wikipedia</a>) For detailled coverage, see Digita's
<a href="http://www.digita.fi/kuluttajat/karttapalvelu/tv_n_karttapalvelu">
coverage map</a>.</p>

<p>After a successful pilot stage our plan is to raise funds for
continuous (24/7) distribution in the whole country and possibly in
other parts of the world, too.</p>

<h3 id="financing">Financing</h3>
<p>This section focuses on distribution and financing. Personally, this is
the more uninteresting part of the project. If someone is interested
in these practical matters, please <a href="mailto:joel.lehtonen+broadcast@iki.fi">contact me</a>.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> 2014-07-05: We have found a partner who is
able to cover costs for the pilot stage. The pilot stage will start in
August or September, 2014 and last for 2 months. More information is
coming soon.</p>
<p>There is plan to start regular broadcasting soon after the pilot
stage. A single month of broadcasting on current distribution area
(multiplex E) including maintenance costs is about 2000 euros (VAT
included) per month. We are currently looking for partners to that
stage.</p>
<p>I have had a quick look at bitcoin crowdfunding. My first
impression is that the available platforms are not very good either
technologically or by the number of users. If someone has ideas how to
collect funds for this project, please inform me.</p>

<!-- Who we are? -->

<h3 id="contribution">How to contribute</h3>

<p>In Finland we have this thing
called <a href="http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2006/en20060255.pdf">Money
Collection Act</a> which means that it is not legal to ask money
without compensation. However, in this case the compensation is the
radio broadcast.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> 2014-07-05: The project's bitcoin address
is still here and all funds sent there will be used for covering
regular broadcasting costs. If the project gets cancelled, all extra
funds will be returned to their sending addresses.</p>

<p>In addition to financial support you are welcome to join the team if you are capable of helping me with the serializer/deserializer, to improve web pages, or anything else. Please contact me by <a href="mailto:joel.lehtonen+broadcast@iki.fi">e-mail</a>.</p>
