<h3 id="general-description">General description</h2>
<p>I am developing a project named bitcoin-broadcast. Its goal is to
enable bitcoin transactions, block serialization and transmission over
radio waves. Any one-way digital transmission path with sufficient
error correction is suitable for this project. The overall goal is to
use public broadcasting, e.g., digital television (DVB-T) or
subcarriers of FM radio transmission. At early stages it is natural to
use license-free frequencies.</p>
<p>The projects consists of two separate applications: transmitting
serializer and receiving deserializer. The former connects to the the
bitcoin network, receives transactions and blocks, then puts them into
a queue, which is processed according to priorities. The result is
sent to serial communication apparatus. On the other end, the receiver
connects to the serial communication apparatus, processes the received
transactions and blocks, and sends them to bitcoin nodes. The data
stream can contain other information, such as exchange rates between
bitcoins and traditional currencies.</p>
<p>This scheme makes it easy to construct affordable receivers that do
not need mobile data connections in order to follow bitcoin traffic an
to react to the received bitcoin payments. This would make it possible
to build bitcoin counterpart for cash payment terminals, e.g., coin
operated self-service laundry. If the receiver application followed
only transactions relevant to itself, it could be build even with an
8-bit microcontroller. The bill of materials for this kind of receiver
would be extremely low.</p>
<p>Already done:</p>
<ul>
<li>Serializer connects and stays in the bitcoin network.</li>
<li>Serializer knows how to send transactions and blocks to serial port.</li>
<li>Serializer optimizes the sent blocks by referencing to already sent transactions, and does not retransmit them in a new block (exactly as the bitcoin network normally operates).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not yet finished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper transaction prioritization. Currently vulnerable to penny flooding.</li>
<li>Serial traffic format needs rethinking and someone else's opinion.</li>
<li>Serial traffic signing. The receiver needs to be sure that the data has not been forged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not yet started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiver applicaltion (deserializer).</li>
<li>Testing in real radio network.</li>
<li>Sending exchange rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The application is programmed in C (gnu99) and it depends on Glib,
LibSSL and Linux. It is licensed under GNU GPL v3. The sources are in
GitHub: https://github.com/zouppen/bitcoin-broadcast. The site also
tells how you can support the project financially. Even more useful
would be if you know and want to help with the execution of the
project!</p>
<h3 id="financing">Financing</h2>
<p>I will now focus on distribution and financing. Personally, this is
the more uninteresting part of the project. If someone is interested
in these practical matters, please contact me.</p>
<p>The pilot stage could be executed during a couple of months at
night time (distribution between midnight and 6 a.m.) and smaller
distribution area, e.g. channel group E, until the system is stable
enough to be used for 24 hours in the whole country. It would be
possible to receive the pilot stage transmissions in most areas of
Finland.</p>
<p>Because crowdfunding is difficult in Finland, the reward for
financing the project could be an advertisement, which the startup
would sell. The contributors would be mentioned in the web page but
each contributor could create a message that would be randomly
assigned to the radio transmitted data stream, weighted according to
the amount of money contributed. Maybe something like this could
work.</p>
<p>I have had a quick look at bitcoin crowdfunding. My first
impression is that the available platforms are not very good either
technologically or by the number of users. If someone has ideas how to
collect seed funds for this project, please inform me. A minimum of
2000 euros (about 5 BTC) would be needed for the pilot stage even if I
do not count my own work. More would be needed if the tests are
promising and a wider distribution is in order.</p>
<p>(If the project's bitcoin address would mysteriously receive &gt;5
BTC during the next few days, it would be a lot easier because
financial planning could be pushed forward and the pilot stage could
be started early.)</p>
