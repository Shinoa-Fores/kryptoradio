<h2 id="general">What is Kryptoradio?</h2>
<p>Kryptoradio is a bitcoin data transmission system that</p>
<ul>
<li>transmits bitcoin transactions, blocks, and currency exchange data,</li>
<li>does all this in real-time,</li>
<li>uses terrestrial television (<a title="Digital Video Broadcasting — Terrestrial" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVB-T">DVB-T</a>) transmitters around the world.</li>
<li><strong>Bitcoins in the air</strong>, literally speaking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Any unidirectional digital transmission path with a sufficient
error correction is suitable for this project. In addition to DVB-T there are many other possible ways to transmit Bitcoin stream like subcarriers of FM radio transmission, amateur radio, and DAB. We chose DVB-T for our pilot project because of its flexibility and wide support in most parts of the world, shown in blue in the map below (source: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Digital_broadcast_standards.svg">Wikipedia</a>).</p>

<p>The primary motivators are</p>
<ul>
<li>creating unprecedented devices and applications,</li>
<li>making the bitcoin network more resistant to attacks,</li>
<li>promoting bitcoin as a viable payment platform, and of course
<li><strong>because we can!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There has been many attempts to make bitcoin less dependent of the
public Internet. For example Bitcoin core developer Greg Maxwell has
advocated that. One approach is to
use <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">Tor</a> network to hide
bitcoin traffic from the public Internet. Unfortunately this does not
make bitcoin more accessible to new users. The better approach is to
go beyond Internet and <strong>use public infrastructure for
broadcasting</strong> transactions of the bitcoin network.</p>

<p>This scheme makes it easy to construct <strong>affordable receivers</strong> that do
not need mobile data connections in order to follow bitcoin traffic and
to react to the received bitcoin payments. This would make it possible
to build bitcoin counterpart for cash payment terminals, anything from
a cash register to a coin operated self-service laundry. If the
receiver application follows only transactions relevant to itself, it
will be possible to build it using even an ARM
microcontroller.</p>

<p>Also, it allows an alternative way to access the bitcoin network in
cases where only a very low speed Internet connection is
available. And, for all the tin foil hat wearers out
there, this is a way to <strong>connect to bitcoin network without a
trace</strong>! You only need online access when you want to make
transactions yourself.</p>

<p>The data stream can contain other information, such
as <strong>exchange rates</strong> between bitcoins and traditional
currencies.</p>

<p>We have found a partner who is able to cover costs for the pilot
stage. The pilot stage will start in <strong>1st of September,
2014</strong> and last for 2 months. The broadcast area covers 95% of
Finnish population, approximately <strong>5 million</strong>
people. More information in the <a href="/press">press
release</a>.</p>

<p>There is plan to start regular broadcasting soon after the pilot
stage. A single month of broadcasting on current distribution area
including maintenance costs is about <strong>€ 2000 per
month</strong> (VAT included). We are currently looking for partners
to that stage.</p>

<p>We have had a quick look at bitcoin crowdfunding. Our first
impression is that the available platforms are not very good either
technologically or by the number of users. If someone has ideas how to
collect funds for this project, please contact us!</p>

<!-- Who we are? -->

<h3 id="contribution">How to contribute</h3>

<p>In Finland we have this thing
called <a href="http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2006/en20060255.pdf">Money
Collection Act</a> which means that it is not legal to ask money
without compensation. However, in this case the compensation is the
radio broadcast.</p>

<p>All funds sent to the project's bitcoin address
will be used for covering
regular broadcasting costs. If the project gets cancelled, all extra
funds will be returned to their sending addresses.</p>

<p>In addition to financial support you are welcome to join the team if you are capable of helping me with the software, to improve web pages, or anything else. Please contact me by <a href="mailto:joel.lehtonen+broadcast@iki.fi">e-mail</a>.</p>
