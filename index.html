<h3 id="general-description">General description</h2>
<p>We are developing a project named Bitcoin Radio. Its goal is to
transmit all bitcoin transactions, blocks, and currency exchange data real-time using Terrestrial television (DVB-T) transmitters around the world. Bitcoins in the air, literally speaking.</p>
<p>Any unidirectional digital transmission path with a sufficient
error correction is suitable for this project. In addition to DVB-T there are many other possible ways to transmit Bitcoin stream like subcarriers of FM radio transmission, amateur radio, and DAB. We chose DVB-T for our pilot project because of its flexibility and wide support in most parts of the world.</p>
<img src="images/640px-Digital_broadcast_standards.png" title="Terrestrial television systems worldwide" />
<p>The software part of this project consists of two separate applications: serializer and deserializer. The former connects to the the
bitcoin network, receives transactions and blocks, then puts them into
a queue, which is then processed according to given priorities and finally serialized to a stream of bytes. The result is
passed to transmitter. On the other end, a tuner is connected to deserializer
which parses the incoming stream and emulates a bitcoin node which serves transactions and blocks to all connected bitcoin nodes.
</p>
<p>
The data stream can contain other information, such as <strong>exchange rates</strong>
between bitcoins and traditional currencies.</p>
<p>This scheme makes it easy to construct <strong>affordable receivers</strong> that do
not need mobile data connections in order to follow bitcoin traffic an
to react to the received bitcoin payments. This would make it possible
to build bitcoin counterpart for cash payment terminals, anything from
a cash register to a coin operated self-service laundry. If the
receiver application follows only transactions relevant to itself, it
could be possible to be build it even using an 8-bit
microcontroller.</p>
<p>Also, it allows an alternative way access to Bitcoin network in cases where only very low speed Internet connection is available. When the block sizes grow in the future, this scales up. <strong>Handling of 10 megabyte blocks of the future is not an issue.</strong> And for every tin foil hat out there, this is a way to <strong>connect to Bitcoin network without a trace</strong>! You only need on-line accesss when you want to make transactions yourself.</p>

<h3 id="done">Current status:</p>

<h4 id="software">The software:</h4>

<p>The application is programmed in C (gnu99) and it depends on Glib,
LibSSL and Linux. It is licensed under GNU GPL v3. The sources are available from
<a href="https://github.com/zouppen/bitcoin-broadcast">GitHub</a>.

<ul>
<li>Serializer connects and stays in the bitcoin network.</li>
<li>Serializer knows how to send transactions and blocks to serial port.</li>
<li>Serializer optimizes the sent blocks by referencing to already sent transactions, and does not retransmit them in a new block (exactly as the bitcoin network normally operates).</li>
</ul>
<p>Not yet finished:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proper transaction prioritization. Currently vulnerable to penny flooding.</li>
<li>Serial traffic format needs rethinking and someone else's opinion.</li>
<li>Serial traffic signing. The receiver needs to be sure that the data has not been forged.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not yet started:</p>
<ul>
<li>Receiver applicaltion (deserializer).</li>
<li>Testing in real radio network.</li>
<li>Sending exchange rates.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="contracts">Distribution contracts and legal questions</h4>

<p>We are currently negotiating of a possibility to start test transmissions in Finland using Digita's DVB-T network. There should be no legal pitfalls in Finland because bitcoin is considered legal (though it has no currency status, yet).</p>

<p>The pilot stage could be executed during a couple of months at
night time (distribution between midnight and 6 a.m.) and smaller
distribution area, e.g. channel group E (see Digita's <a href="http://www.digita.fi/kuluttajat/karttapalvelu/tv_n_karttapalvelu">coverage map</a>), until the system is stable
enough to be used for 24 hours in the whole country. It would be
possible to receive the pilot stage transmissions in most areas of
Finland.</p>

<p>Because crowdfunding is difficult in Finland, the reward for
financing the project could be an advertisement, which the startup
would sell. The contributors would be mentioned in the web page but
each contributor could create a message that would be randomly
assigned to the radio transmitted data stream, weighted according to
the amount of money contributed. Maybe something like this could
work.</p>

<h3 id="financing">Financing</h2>
<p>I will now focus on distribution and financing. Personally, this is
the more uninteresting part of the project. If someone is interested
in these practical matters, please contact me.</p>
<p>I have had a quick look at bitcoin crowdfunding. My first
impression is that the available platforms are not very good either
technologically or by the number of users. If someone has ideas how to
collect seed funds for this project, please inform me. A minimum of
2000 euros (about 5 BTC) would be needed for the pilot stage even if I
do not count my own work. More would be needed if the tests are
promising and a wider distribution is in order.</p>
<p>(If the project's bitcoin address would mysteriously receive &gt;5
BTC during the next few days, it would be a lot easier because
financial planning could be pushed forward and the pilot stage could
be started early.)</p>

<h3 id="contribution">How to contribute</h3>

<p>Donations are welcome from outside Finland. (In Finland we have this thing called <a href="http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/2006/en20060255.pdf">Money Collection Act</a> which means that as it's not legal to ask money without compensation. However it's legal to donate money in Finland. Don't ask me the logic.)</p>

<p>In addition to financial support you are welcome to join the team if you are capable of helping me with the serializer/deserializer, to improve web pages, or anything else. Please contact me by <a href="mailto:joel.lehtonen+broadcast@iki.fi">e-mail</a>.</p>
